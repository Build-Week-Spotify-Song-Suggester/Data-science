## Flowchart


## Project Info
For the Data Science portion of this application, we used this Kaggle [Spotify Audio Features](https://www.kaggle.com/tomigelo/spotify-audio-features) Dataset. Within for every track and it's artist, you can also find Spotify's Track Id, along with a number of audio features such as acousticness, danceability, tempo, speechiness and several more. We took this information we and utilized a  
[KDTree](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KDTree.html) from Scikit Learn. This method finds the songs nearest to each other in terms of the numerical audio features previously mentioned.
